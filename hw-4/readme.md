[Live Monster Portrait](https://rbietry.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

This week I learned how to create shapes, as well as how to color and manipulate those shapes to create artwork in javascript. I used my knowledge of these shapes to create a monster portrait of a witch. I stuck to the template that we were provided, and added more notes so that I could stay organized while I worked. I didn't run into any major problems as I created my portrait, it just took a little while to get the right placement for each of my shapes.
