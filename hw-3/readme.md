["Hello World!" Sketch](https://rbietry.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

This week I learned how to create a canvas and change the background color as well as add text to a js document. I went through each section of the class website and followed along with the videos and intructions to learn how to do these things. I didn't come across any problems or issues because the instructions were thorough. I didn't need any help from my classmates to complete the assignment, and I was unable to help my classmates with their problems because I did not remember to check the issues page before the assignment was due.
