[Algorithmic Sketch](https://rbietry.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

This week I learned a lot about how to use math functions to create an algorithmic sketch. It was difficult to try to use everything I learned in one project, but it got easier as I spent time learning the new functions. It's fun to watch the sketch draw itself.
