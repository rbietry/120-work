[Live Animation Sketch](https://rbietry.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)

I modified my sketch from week 5 to use separate functions to draw the elements rather than crowding my draw function. It is helpful to be able to split up different elements into different functions to work on them separately. I have a better understanding of functions now and hope to create more of my own. I also added an array that creates a subliminal message because the framerate is too fast to actually read it.
