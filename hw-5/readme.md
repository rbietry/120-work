[Live Animation Sketch](https://rbietry.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

This week I learned a lot about the draw function, and used my knowledge to create an interactive animation. I chose to animate the eyes of a character to follow the movement of the cursor. It was a little difficult to figure out how to do this on my own, but after playing with it for a while I got it to work the way I wanted it to. It was fun to work with something animatied and interactive since it feels like a mini game.
