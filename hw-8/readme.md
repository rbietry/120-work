I learned how to work with for loops and while loops to help make my life easier when trying to draw multiples of one shape. I started with a background filled in by evenly spaced and sized circles that change color in a for loop. Then I also added a while loop on top of that which draws randomly sized and spaced circles across the canvas, and resets before it fills the canvas.
